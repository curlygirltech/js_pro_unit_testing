Test File Name Syntax- Usually named w/ file that has the functions you're testing
then adding .spec or .test 
Example- helper.spec.js or helper.test.js

Give function an input and test for the expected output
What do we expect the funtion to do? => confirm that output is met 


3 parts of a Unit test 

describe =  what you're testing (func or component)
it = what does it do?
expect = what is the expected output with a specificied input?

Starting out the test
Describe/it block is the syntax for Jest tests, it usually has the name of func or component
with a callback function that has the "it" block which holds what you're testing.
Be descriptive the it block serves as documentation and allows others to easily see what you're testing for!



Describe('funcName', ()=>{
 it('has expected output',()=>{
  const input = [1,2,3]

  expect(funcName(input)).toEqual(output) you expect your func or component to give you give you an output w/ an expected input
  expect(funcName(input)).toHaveLength(10) this should be a number since you're looking for length
 })
})

expect
there are a bunch of methods you can use with jest- toBeCalled, toEqual, toHaveLength etc.
